3
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,530
*Don't you wanna go down*

6
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,950
*Don't you wanna go down*

9
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,660
*Don't you wanna go down*

11
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,090
Somebody make some motherfucking noise in here!

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,350
Fuck these people.

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,120
Man, this place is unbelievable.

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,370
Fucking Goolybib, man.

15
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,120
Those guys build a mediocre piece of software,

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,900
that might be worth something someday,

17
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,350
and now they live here.

18
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,450
There's money flying all over Silicon Valley

19
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,260
but none of it ever seems to hit us.

20
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,500
What the hell are you eating?

21
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,550
Liquid shrimp. It's 200 dollars a quart.

22
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,190
Wylie Dufresne made it.

23
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,940
How does it taste?

24
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,230
Like how I would imagine cum tastes.

25
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,440
You guys taking it all in?

26
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,610
Because this is what it looks like

27
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,340
when Google acquires your company for over 200 million dollars.

28
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,750
Look, Dustin Moskovitz.

30
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,010
Elon Musk. Eric Schmidt.

32
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,830
Whatever the fuck the guy's name is who created Photrio.

33
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,050
I mean, Kid Rock is the poorest person here.

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,580
Apart from you guys.

35
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,000
OK, there's 40 billion dollars

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,150
of net worth, walking around this party.

37
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,350
And you guys are standing around drinking shrimp

38
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,340
and talking about what cum tastes like.

39
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,840
Yeah, I heard that.

40
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,720
You guys live in my incubator

41
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,630
you've got to network. That's why I brought you here.

42
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,270
I got us in here.

43
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,740
Javeed over there is my ex-room-mate.

44
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,030
Yeah, but I drove.

45
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,940
Eric Schmidt, Erlich Bachman.

47
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,010
It's amazing how the men and women at these things

48
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,530
always separate like this.

50
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah, every party in Silicon Valley

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,010
ends up like a Hasidic wedding.

52
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,970
Not even the Goolybib guys were talking to girls.

53
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,660
They don't have to, Big Head.

54
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,550
This house talks to girls.

57
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,870
I got seven words for you.

58
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,080
I love

59
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,010
Goolybib's integrated-

60
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,810
multi-platform-functionality!

61
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,660
But seriously,

62
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,700
you know, a few days ago,

63
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,740
when we were sitting down with Barak Obama,

64
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,570
I turned to these guys and said,

65
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,210
"OK, you know, we're making a lot of money.

66
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,750
And yes, we're disrupting digital media.

67
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,090
But most importantly

68
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,270
we're making the world a better place.

69
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,100
Through constructing elegant hierarchies

70
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,660
for maximum code reuse and extensibility."

71
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,620
So everyone.

72
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,420
Here's to many more nights just like this one.

73
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,180
Take it away, my good friend, Kid Rock.

74
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,290
What a dick.

89
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,870
Big Head, there is a personal ad section

91
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,350
on this Asperger site.

92
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,960
Holy shit, this one is looking for

93
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,630
a "Relationship that has the potential to become

94
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,120
sexual in nature."

95
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,830
Boy, is she on the spectrum.

96
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,480
She can't even make eye contact with the camera.

97
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,350
Richard, can I talk to you for a second?

98
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,440
Solo.

99
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:31,510
We need to talk about Pied Piper.

100
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,150
What about it? The website's up and running,

101
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,590
I'm just redesigning the compression. It just needs users.

102
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,410
Yeah, no shit.

103
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,150
But even if somebody wanted to use it

104
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,660
they wouldn't be able to figure out how to.

105
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,280
It's incomprehensible.

106
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,760
Now, Richard, when you pitched me Pied Piper

107
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,840
you said it was gonna be, "The Google of Music."

108
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,770
which is a really rad way to pitch something.

109
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,570
I mean, I liked it.

110
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,190
I thought it had "Applications".

111
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,160
No, it has all that. Look, when it blows up,

112
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,890
and it will once it reaches a critical mass of users,

113
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,050
Pied Piper will be able to search the whole world

114
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,400
of recorded music to find out if there's a match to see

115
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,580
if you're infringing on any copy righted material.

116
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,850
So, if you're a song writer or a band...

117
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,440
OK, first of all, nobody gives a shit

118
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,800
about stealing other people's music, OK?

119
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,620
Everybody involved in the music industry

120
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,960
is either stealing it or sharing it.

121
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,520
They're all a bunch of assholes, especially Radiohead.

122
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,590
- Look, Richard... - No.

123
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,570
Yeah, they're assholes.

124
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,210
Now, look, Richard, if you want to live here,

125
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,680
you've got to deliver.

126
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,840
I can't have dead weight at my incubator, OK?

127
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,970
Either that, or show some promise for fuck's sake.

128
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,430
Like NipAlert. Big Head's app.

129
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,500
It gives you the location of a woman with erect nipples.

130
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,000
Now, that's something people want.

131
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,520
Richard, you need to get in touch with humanity.

132
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,500
When I sold my company, Aviato,

133
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,550
I wanted to give back. That's why I started this place,

134
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,970
to do something big. To make a difference.

135
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,660
You know, like Steve.

136
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,500
Uh, Jobs or Wozniak?

138
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,050
Steve Jobs or Steve...

139
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,230
Oh, I heard you.

140
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,360
- Which one? - Jobs.

141
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,790
I mean, Jobs was a poser. He didn't even write code.

142
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,220
You just disappeared up your own asshole.

143
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,800
- You know that? You did. - Well, technically...

144
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,570
Big Head, I'm gonna be meditating.

145
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,880
He knew how to package the ideas,

146
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,240
but it was Wozniak that...

147
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,930
What is Hooli? Excellent question.

148
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,640
Hooli isn't just another high tech company.

149
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,590
Hooli isn't just about software.

150
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,930
Hooli. Hooli is about people.

151
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,730
Hooli is about innovative technology

152
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,360
that makes a difference,

153
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,770
transforming the world as we know it.

154
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,540
Making the world a better place,

155
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,500
through minimal message oriented transport layers.

157
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,620
I firmly believe we can only achieve greatness

158
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,830
if first we achieve goodness.

159
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,920
Erlich is gonna kick me out.

160
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,160
And I can't afford to pay rent here.

161
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,480
It's insane. $2800 a month,

162
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,160
$4500 a month... with five people.

163
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,630
Jesus! Why is it so expensive here?

164
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,370
Look at this place, it's a shithole.

165
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,250
Here's another one.

166
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,150
Miss Palo Alto, 2K14.

167
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,420
There she goes.

169
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,130
Oh God, the marketing team is having another bike meeting.

170
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,480
Douchebags.

171
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,420
Yup, another day inside the Gavin Belson cult compound.

172
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,110
Hey, did you hear what Peter Gregory is doing?

173
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,890
You mean buying that island in the Pacific?

174
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,010
No, he's building one actually.

175
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,160
Baller.

176
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,320
Anyway, he's also offering a hundred K

177
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,180
to people willing to skip or drop out of college

178
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,810
to pursue their idea.

179
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,260
I don't know what happened to that guy,

180
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,660
but he really hates college.

181
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,210
Anyway, he's doing a TED TALKS in Palo Alto tonight.

183
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,910
- Should we try to get in? - I dropped out of college.

184
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,840
Maybe I should re-enroll and drop out again.

185
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,070
Try and get the money.

187
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,770
Brogrammers.

188
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,410
Oh, no, no.

189
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,550
Hey, uh, a double macchiato for me, dude.

190
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,590
Yeah.

191
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,820
Hey, Rico, you been working out?

192
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,670
No. No, I have not.

193
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,820
I don't have time to even if I wanted to.

194
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,580
I'm too busy working on my website.

195
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,240
Uh, I just, I don't want to end up being a Hooli lifer.

196
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,730
You know, working here forever.

197
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,960
Yeah, working for the most innovative company in the world,

198
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,020
with top pay and vested stock options.

199
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,030
I can totally see why you wouldn't want that.

200
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,560
Yeah, you're like an artist. An entrepreneur.

201
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,610
An iconoclast.

202
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,140
I don't know, maybe.

203
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,340
Dude, We're just messing with you.

204
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,660
But we really want to help you with your site.

205
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,950
What's it called?

206
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,820
Pied Piper.

207
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,800
- Dude, sounds amazing. - Yeah.

208
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,000
Why don't you shoot it over to us and we'll give it a look.

209
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,150
Maybe we can help.

210
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,400
- Uh, really? - Yeah.

211
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,770
OK, yeah.

212
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,650
I mean it's always good to have more eyes on it.

213
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,600
It's... Sent it.

214
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,160
You're making fun of me.

215
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,300
- Dude, no. - No, you are.

216
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,700
- Aw, Ricky, man. - Ricky. Ricky, come back.

217
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,660
It's actually Richard, so that's...

218
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,370
- Pied wiper. - Wide diaper.

219
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,090
Gates, Ellison,

220
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,940
Jobs, Dell.

221
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,970
All dropped out of college.

222
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,290
Silicon Valley is the cradle of innovation

223
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,700
because of drop outs.

224
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,030
College... has become a cruel

225
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,840
expensive joke on the poor

226
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,860
and the middle class

227
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,120
that benefits only the perpetrators of it.

228
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,970
- The bloated administrators. - You are a dangerous man,

229
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,620
spewing ignorance!

230
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,630
I don't think so.

231
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,990
I'm just saying people should trust themselves

232
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,440
more than a system

233
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,280
that happily churns out unemployed debtors

234
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,610
and provides dubious value.

235
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,970
The true value of a college education is intangible.

236
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,730
The true value of snake-oil is intangible as well.

237
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,110
Fascist.

238
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,720
Anything?

239
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,100
The usual riffs on Twitter and Instagram.

240
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,370
Nothing I'd fund.

241
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,460
Hi, excuse me, Mr. Gregory?

242
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,450
I have an idea I'd love to pitch you, if you have time.

243
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,410
Well, that is before I just give up and go back to college.

244
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,740
Don't! Do not do that.

245
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,500
Go work at Burger King.

246
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,640
Go into the woods and forage for nuts and berries.

247
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,810
Do not go back to college!

248
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,660
I think I have been played.

249
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,140
Fine. Go ahead and pitch.

250
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,460
You have until I fasten the seatbelt in my car.

251
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,720
Thank you so much.

252
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,010
Pied Piper is a proprietary site that lets you find out

253
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,950
if your music is infringing on any existing copyrights.

254
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,180
So, imagine you were a song writer, OK?

255
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,040
I don't think I could write a song.

256
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,100
Yeah, no, just imagine if you were.

257
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,970
I don't even think I could say,

258
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,650
"Pied Piper is a proprietary site."

259
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,890
Well, I just did but it wasn't easy.

260
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,500
Crunching all those songs to find matches

261
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,620
sounds like it would take incredible processing power.

262
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,150
- I mean... - Yes.

263
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,530
Yes, it does.

264
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:38,520
No, no. Its... I made an algorithm.

265
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,250
Look, why don't you send me a link to your project

266
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,110
and we'll take a look.

267
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,300
OK, yeah, great.

268
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,110
I put the prototype up on Github.

270
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,570
Pied Piper. I'll look it up.

271
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:52,560
It's like the fable with the kids

272
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,830
and then the rats and the music.

273
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,180
That is a narrow car.

274
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,890
Fucking billionaires.

276
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,970
Hey, wanna check out twig-boy's website?

277
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,510
Yes, I do.

278
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,670
You have to download your own media player?

279
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,290
Look at me, I traveled back to 2009.

280
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,470
Wait a sec.

281
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,990
What is this file size?

282
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,650
1.2 Megabytes? No way.

283
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:41,400
Wow, that doesn't sound at all downgraded.

284
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,800
The file size is like, half.

285
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,810
And look how fast this search is.

286
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:51,280
Holy shit, how did it find a match that fast?

287
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,580
It's like it's searching compressed files?

288
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,660
No way.

289
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,610
{\an8}2.89

290
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,790
Look at that Weissman score.

291
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,100
2.89.

292
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,660
Hey, Where have you two been?

293
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,150
We're playing the multi-channel router team in five minutes.

294
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,130
OK, how the hell did he do this?

295
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,910
And the compression is totally lossless.

296
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,660
And he's somehow figured out

297
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,040
a way to do a search on a compressed data space.

298
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,270
- Holy shit. - Yeah.

299
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,260
And I don't think he even realizes what he has here.

300
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,620
He's using it for some silly songwriter app.

301
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,170
All these guys are like that, they're all about consumer facing.

302
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,990
Right, but you take something like this,

303
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,690
make it business facing and use it for enterprise?

304
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,760
The applications could be endless.

305
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,780
Hey, I thought you were a Satanist?

306
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,230
I'm a LaVeyan Satanist with some theistic tendencies.

307
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,560
Oh, some theistic tendencies.

308
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,290
Well then, what's with the cross?

309
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,250
It's an upside down cross.

310
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,910
Not from here it isn't.

311
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,830
Oh, I see, you know what you should do?

312
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,790
You should get another tattoo that says, "This side up" On it.

313
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,360
How does this translate into Farsi?

314
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,080
That's not the language I speak.

315
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,080
Frontier Airlines just happened to like mine, Aviato.

316
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,010
And that's how I got to where I am.

317
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,760
So... what do you got?

318
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,090
OK, here it is.

319
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,950
Bit Soup.

321
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,900
It's like alphabet soup but

322
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,050
it's ones and zeros instead of the letters.

323
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,700
'Cause it's binary.

324
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,320
You know, binary is just ones and zeroes.

325
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,840
Yeah, I know what binary is.

326
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,420
Jesus Christ! I memorized the hexadecimal times tables

327
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,520
when I was 14 writing machine code!

328
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,200
OK. Ask me what nine times F is. It's fleventyfive.

330
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,830
I do not need you telling me what binary is,

331
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:48,840
just like I don't need you

332
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,570
thinking about soup or taking pictures of it.

333
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,410
I need you thinking about apps, software, websites.

334
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,750
This is Silicon Valley, all right, not...

335
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,820
Paris, Texas.

336
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,280
That's where Campbell's Soup is.

337
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,290
It's the Hooli number again.

338
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,740
It's probably those brogrammers.

339
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,370
Can't wait to tell me how stupid my website is.

340
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,460
Assholes.

341
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:20,060
Hello, Richard Hendricks. I'm a total fucking retard.

342
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,010
Uh. Hi, this is Jared Dunn calling from Hooli.

343
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,780
I'm calling a behalf of Gavin Belson.

344
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,270
I didn't... hi.

345
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,130
Gavin is very excited about your Pied Piper application

346
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,950
and we were wondering if you could come in

347
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,580
for a sit-down with us.

348
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,800
- Are you available now. - OK.

349
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,020
- Sure. Yes. - OK, we'll be here.

350
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,010
Good-bye.

351
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,950
Uh, I have a meeting with Gavin Belson.

352
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,350
He likes Pied Piper.

353
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,220
I own 10 percent of Pied Piper.

354
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,670
You said it was a shitty idea.

355
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,330
It was a shitty idea.

356
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,300
I'm not sure what it is now.

357
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,660
- What time's the meeting? - Right now.

358
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,190
I'm gonna need a better shirt.

359
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,020
Holy shit.

360
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,860
What the fuck am I waiting for? See ya.

361
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,940
Well, it's like Gavin always says,

362
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,960
"It takes change to make change."

363
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,450
Yeah, I think I've seen that written around.

364
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,830
Gavin is running 30 minutes late

365
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:33,470
but you should know he is very excited to see you, Richard.

366
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,100
He's with his spiritual advisor.

367
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,540
He shouldn't be that much longer.

368
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,410
I'm a VP here

369
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,810
and I only get to see him about ten minutes a month.

370
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,990
But that 10 minutes is just incredible.

371
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,500
I heard Richard Hendricks was here.

372
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,910
Have you ever met Gavin before?

373
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,490
- No. - No?

374
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,530
Oh, I told him, it's amazing.

375
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,020
That hardly begins to describe it.

376
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,780
It's weird.

377
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,160
They always travel in groups of five.

378
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,620
These programmers, there's always a tall skinny white guy,

379
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,550
short skinny Asian guy,

380
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,530
fat guy with a ponytail,

381
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,090
some guy with crazy facial hair

382
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,010
and then an East Indian guy.

383
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,790
It's like they trade guys

384
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,320
until they all have the right group.

385
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:26,250
You clearly have a great understanding of humanity.

386
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,140
And Gavin said: I'm not humiliating you,

387
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,750
I'm elevating you.

388
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,960
Ah, Gavin.

389
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,530
This is Richard.

390
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,190
It's Peter Gregory.

391
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,950
Ah, no.

393
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,320
Come on, Big Head.

394
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,120
Yeah, I'm coming. Slow...

395
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,880
Why are you going that fast?

396
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,270
Cause we've got a meeting with Gavin Belson. Pick up the pace.

397
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,470
- We honestly don't. - Come on.

398
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,180
I'm actually outside of

399
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,020
Gavin Belson's office right now, Mr. Gregory.

400
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,930
Uh, here he comes, so can I call you back in...

401
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,000
So, Richard Hendricks is here!

402
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,100
There you are, Richard.

403
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,150
So sorry these gentleman have kept you waiting.

404
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,970
- That's fine. - So here's the thing.

405
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,380
I love what you did.

406
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,700
- Really? - Fill him in, Jared.

407
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,510
Now, as you know, Hooli is seen as possibly

408
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,800
the most progressive company in the world.

409
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,740
Part of that is Gavin's commitment to social justice,

410
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,030
but part of it is his personal commitment

411
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,780
to the people that work at Hooli.

412
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,160
In that spirit Gavin is

413
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,290
prepared to give you a very substantial raise...

414
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,840
and a promotion to go with it.

415
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,580
I own 10 percent.

416
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,760
He created it while living in my incubator.

417
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,780
Erlich Bachman. This is Big Head.

418
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,450
I don't know what any of that means,

419
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,370
but I'll give you six hundred thousand dollars for it.

420
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,390
We have the reach and the resources to take what you have done

421
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,240
and push it to the global level.

422
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,610
That is a generous offer.

423
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,610
Shit, sorry. Hello.

424
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,960
Really? No shit, that's...

425
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,020
Uh, yeah, yeah. No here. It's Peter Gregory.

426
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,350
Not sure how he got my number?

427
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,010
Uh, this is Richard.

428
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,490
I'll give you three million dollars for it right now!

429
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,700
Ah, Gavin Belson just offered

430
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,450
me three million dollars for Pied Piper.

431
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,610
I'm prepared to give you three hundred thousand dollars.

432
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,590
Peter Gregory just offered me 300, um...

433
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,300
Did you say thousand dollars?

434
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,780
For ten percent of your company.

435
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,270
OK, four million.

436
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,870
200 thousand.

437
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,390
- For five percent. - Huh?

438
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,780
You just went down.

439
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,790
No, you're still valued at four million dollars.

440
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,470
But you own ninety-five

441
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,140
percent of a potential billion-dollar company.

442
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:02,770
And not just that, I will help you build this company.

443
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,250
I will introduce you to the people you need to know

444
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,850
and provide the counsel that you need.

445
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,160
I will take a small piece, but the company will belong to you.

446
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,950
not Gavin Belson.

447
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,190
You have until tomorrow to decide.

448
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,690
Ah, OK.

449
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,810
- Um, you know... - Pull your head out of your ass, Richard.

450
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,500
I'm offering you four million dollars right now.

451
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,530
I'm....

452
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,820
That is a lot of money.

453
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,180
You know, I actually have to...

454
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,740
I've got to go to the bathroom.

455
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,020
I've got to pee.

456
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,060
It's desperate. I'm bursting.

457
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,640
I'll be right back, but right now...

458
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,730
OK, 10 million.

459
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,940
No. Maybe.

460
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,700
I didn't mean to snap at you.

461
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,560
I'll talk... in a bit.

462
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,490
Won't be long.

463
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,980
Little more about me.

464
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,940
I am the founder of Aviato.

465
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,650
and I own a very small percentage of Grindr.

466
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,300
It's a men to men dating site

467
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,590
where you can find other men within 10 miles of you,

468
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,370
interested in having sexual intercourse in a public restroom.

469
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,700
In the homosexual community there's sometimes anonymous...

470
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,050
I know what Grindr is.

471
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:20,980
I have gay friends.

473
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,000
So you will survive.

474
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,180
It's just a garden-variety panic attack.

475
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,100
Welcome to Silicon Valley.

476
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,130
We see people like you all the time.

477
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,670
- Really? - Yes.

478
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,110
It's just I have to make this decision by tomorrow.

479
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,640
Yeah. You know, a while back, we had a guy in here,

480
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,120
in almost the exact same situation,

481
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,730
"Take the money or keep the company."

482
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:51,920
What happened?

483
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,630
Well, a couple months later

484
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,030
he was brought into the ER with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

485
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,020
I guess he really regretted not taking that money.

486
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,320
He shot himself because he turned down the money?

487
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,170
Yeah.

488
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,750
Or no, he took the money.

489
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,110
Or no.

490
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,750
No, he did not. I don't... You know what?

491
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,380
I don't remember. But whatever it was,

492
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,540
he regretted it so much that he ended up shooting himself.

493
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,350
- And now he's blind. - He's blind?

494
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,250
Yeah, just FYI,

495
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,430
if you're ever gonna shoot yourself,

496
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,900
don't hold the gun up to your temple, OK?

497
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,080
Because that just basically just took out

498
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,820
both of his optic nerves and then, you know,

499
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,200
half of his face.

500
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,170
And then his wife left him, because, you know.

501
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,550
- Yikes. - Right.

502
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,590
He may have been a genius programmer

503
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,020
but not so much in human anatomy.

504
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,970
Or decision making, for that matter.

505
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,890
Now he's got to live with all that

506
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,520
and whatever terrible decision he made about the money.

507
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:44,780
Uh. And what do I do if I feel another panic attack coming on.

508
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,260
Would you be interested in a device

509
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,360
that links up to your smartphone

510
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,870
and it keeps track of your vitals

511
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,660
and it tells you, even before it's happening,

512
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,250
whether you're having a panic attack or an actual heart attack?

513
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,760
Yeah, that sounds great.

514
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,040
You would, right?

515
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,050
OK, that's great news.

516
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,250
Because it's still in prototype phase right now,

517
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,130
but my start-up partners and I are looking for investors.

518
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:06,830
Like today.

519
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,230
So will you please let me know...

520
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,350
I'm going to give you my number.

521
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,370
If you do end up taking that 10 million dollars

522
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:15,410
because we could really make the world a better place.

523
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,810
Whoa! Oh, jeez!

524
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:25,920
Richard.

525
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:29,050
Hi, Monica. I work with Peter Gregory.

526
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,190
We met outside the TED...

527
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,220
Yeah, I remember you.

528
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:34,400
What... How'd you know I was here?

529
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,070
Peter Gregory is investing in a company

530
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,620
that uses GPS in phones to track people.

531
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,450
That's creepy.

532
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,990
You don't know the half of it.

533
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,920
And neither does Congress.

534
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,540
Are you OK?

535
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,320
Look, I don't want to waste your time.

536
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,720
I think I gotta take the money from Gavin Belson.

537
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,100
At least this way when I blow my eyeballs out

538
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,240
I'll have some money left for my family.

539
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,290
Jesus.

540
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:03,980
Sorry. That is a terrible doctor in there.

541
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:07,490
Richard, buried in that clunky UI of yours

542
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,330
is a compression algorithm that blew our engineering team away.

543
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,790
And what do you think Hooli is going to do with it?

544
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,120
I don't know. That's their business.

545
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,510
This is your baby.

546
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,930
Do you even realize the impact that a compression

547
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,690
this good could have on the world?

548
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,820
Getting any file on your mobile phone in an instant.

549
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:27,490
Navigation data for self-driving cars,

550
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,960
mobile medical imagery,

551
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,670
all transmitting with no quality loss.

552
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,330
This is game-changing.

553
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,380
Don't you want to be in the driver's seat when that happens?

554
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,770
You really want to just turn it all over to Hooli

555
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,810
and walk away?

556
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,510
Well, you are not making this easier for me.

557
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,430
I'm not trying to.

558
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,390
I mean you're actually making it worse.

559
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,780
My hands are tingling. I have this metal taste in my mouth.

560
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,790
Actually, I can't go back in there, so I'm going to go home.

561
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,070
- Let me give you a ride home. - Good to see you again.

562
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,900
Uh, OK. Thanks.

563
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,010
Dude, where have you been?

564
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,270
Why won't you answer your phone?

565
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,380
Man, this has grown way beyond AngelList.

567
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,410
Andreesen, Elevation and like a bunch of

568
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,880
other seed funds are piling onto this thing.

569
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,600
I mean, they've been calling Erlich.

570
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,940
He's out of control.

571
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,590
What if we took Peter Gregory's 200K

572
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,920
and built our own company?

573
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,830
I'm sorry. You said we.

574
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,760
Who's that in reference to exactly?

575
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,470
You, me, Dinesh, Big Head, us.

576
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,650
I mean, right now Pied Piper just does audio,

577
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,920
but I'm thinking of ways to compress images, video...

578
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,450
I mean, maybe Peter Gregory's right.

579
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,810
Maybe this could be huge.

580
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,080
Look, guys, for thousands of years

581
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,830
guys like us have gotten the shit kicked out of us.

582
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,440
But now, for the first time, we are living in an era

583
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:46,500
where we can be in charge and build empires.

584
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,980
We could be the Vikings of our day.

585
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,040
- Vikings? - How are you feeling?

586
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,710
You look super fucked up, to be honest.

587
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:59,230
Who ate my fucking quinoa again?

588
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,310
So you're really about to go tell Erlich

589
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,030
that he's not going to get his one million dollars?

590
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:05,100
Yeah, I don't want to be there when you do that.

591
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,760
I would like to be there when you do that.

592
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,570
No, just stay here, please.

593
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,390
Um, so, I've been thinking about

594
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:22,560
this whole Peter Gregory, Gavin Belson thing.

595
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,080
And, um, I think I'm going to go with Peter Gregory.

596
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,410
- Uh, which I know means... - Richard.

597
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,210
I know that you look at me,

598
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,360
and see a guy who has it all figured out.

599
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,730
And for the most part, you're right, I do.

600
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,890
When I sold Aviato,

601
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,610
it gave me a house, money, fancy clothes,

602
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,730
the universal respect of all the ladies.

603
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,390
But there's always been a hole in my heart.

604
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,510
Not a literal hole like you would find

605
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:55,160
in some babies with congenital diseases,

606
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,510
but a metaphorical hole.

607
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,650
I guess that hole is the "What if".

608
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,380
What if I didn't sell?

609
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,800
I'll never know.

610
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,080
And so I guess what I'm saying to you now is,

611
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,940
you're like me, Richard.

612
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,180
You want to build something

613
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,700
and see it through.

614
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,690
So, just to be clear.

615
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,950
You're all right with me saying no to a deal

616
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,780
that will net you a million dollars outright?

617
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,450
No, Richard. I'm not all right with it.

618
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:24,130
I'm excited about it.

619
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,030
Let's see how high this rocket can fly, partner.

620
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,490
OK. Great.

621
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,650
That's great.

622
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,350
Not partners, exactly.

623
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,780
But everything else is great.

624
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,180
Call it what you want.

625
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,910
Always blue, always blue, always blue,

626
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,490
always blue, always blue, always blue,

627
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,260
always blue, always...

628
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,380
Oh! That was a yellow.

629
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,750
What was that, 17?

630
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,380
- Pretty good. - Hey, guys...

631
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,410
Guys, can I just kind of say something real quick?

632
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,700
I know it's stupid but, um...

633
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,310
I just want to say, uh,

634
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:09,760
I'd like for this company to be different than Hooli

635
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,910
and Goolybib and all the rest, you know?

636
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,550
Like, let's like not turn this into a corporate cult

637
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,150
with bike meetings and voluntary retreats

638
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,500
that are actually mandatory.

639
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,300
And claiming to make the world a better place all the time.

640
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,000
Let's, uh, let's just think different.

642
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,290
Don't think different. That's Apple.

643
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,620
Let's just... let's just do it.

645
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,140
- That's Nike, man. - I know that's Nike.

646
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,350
Fuck it. I don't know.

647
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,210
Let's just make it... Let's just make it happen.

648
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,650
Yeah, agreed.

649
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,680
To his beneficence.

650
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,960
Peter Gregory?

651
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:47,050
- The dark lord. - Of course, the dark lord.

652
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,470
Big Head.

653
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,990
God, he's worse high.

654
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,940
Always blue, always blue,

655
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,000
always blue, always blue...
